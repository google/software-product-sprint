# Datastore

## Getting Started

This walkthrough introduces Datastore, which lets you store data permanently.

You can return to this walkthrough anytime by running this command:

```bash

## The Goal

The goal of this project is to use Datastore to permanently store the comments
you implemented in the previous step.

This walkthrough introduces a lot of concepts, but you don't have to use all of
them. Decide what makes sense for your goal.

Don't be afraid to get creative, but focus on finishing a
[minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)
that proves you have all of the pieces connected, and then come back later and
add extra features if you have time left over.

## Persistent Storage

So far, you've used a data structure like `ArrayList` to store comments in
memory. But what happens if you have more comments than fit in memory? What
happens when your server restarts, or when App Engine automatically scales your
server up or down?

The answer is that your data will be erased. This won't work for data that you
want to store permanently.

The solution to this problem is to use **persistent storage** to store the data
somewhere safer. You might use a database, or file storage.

[Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/datastore/) is
a [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database that allows you to store
and load data using Java code.

The next few steps introduce Datastore through an example that stores tasks in a
todo list.

## Example

The `todo-list` directory contains an example project that uses Datastore to
store tasks posted by the user. The next few steps will walk you through this
example project.

## Maven Dependency

Datastore comes with the App Engine environment, so to use Datastore, first add
the App Engine dependency to your
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="software-product-sprint/portfolio/pom.xml">
  pom.xml
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.appengine</groupId>
  <artifactId>appengine-api-1.0-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>1.9.78</version>
</dependency>
```

This dependency allows you to reference the classes that come with the App
Engine SDK, which includes Datastore.

## DatastoreService

Open the
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-2-server/examples/todo-list/src/main/java/com/google/sps/servlets/NewTaskServlet.java">
  NewTaskServlet.java
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
file in the `todo-list` directory to see how it uses Datastore to save a task.

To use Datastore, you first need an instance of the `DatastoreService` class.
You can call the `DatastoreServiceFactory.getDatastoreService()` function:

```java
DatastoreService datastore = DatastoreServiceFactory.getDatastoreService();
```

Now you can use this `datastore` variable to interact with Datastore.

You can read more about `DataStoreService`
[here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/datastore/DatastoreService.html).

## Entities

Data in Datastore is represented by **entities**. You can think of an entity
similar to how you think about an instance of a class in Java.

An entity has a **kind**, which is similar to a class name.

Look at the `doPost()` function in the
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-2-server/examples/todo-list/src/main/java/com/google/sps/servlets/NewTaskServlet.java">
  NewTaskServlet.java
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
file to see how it creates an `Entity` by giving it a *kind* of `Task`:

```java
Entity taskEntity = new Entity("Task");
```

This line of code creates an `Entity` with a *kind* of `Task` and stores it in a
`taskEntity` variable.

An entity also has **properties**, similar to how a class can have variables.
Each property is a **key** and a **value**. To set a property, you call the
`setProperty()` function:

```java
taskEntity.setProperty("title", title);
taskEntity.setProperty("timestamp", timestamp);
```

This code adds two properties to the `taskEntity` entity: `title` and
`timestamp`. Property values can be strings, numbers, or timestamps. See
[this guide](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/entities#datastore-datastore-upsert-java)
to learn more about the types of values you can store in an entity.

### Storing Entities

Now that you have a `datastore` variable and a `taskEntity` variable, you can
store the entity by passing it into the `datastore.put()` function:

```java
datastore.put(taskEntity);
```

This function stores `taskEntity` in Datastore so that you can load it next time
you need it.

## Your Turn

Modify your
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="software-product-sprint/portfolio/src/main/java/com/google/sps/servlets/DataServlet.java">
  DataServlet.java
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
file to store the comments as entities in Datastore. Get this working before
you worry about loading the data.

### Admin Page

Datastore includes an admin page that gives you access to its data. This is very
useful for debugging and managing your data.

To view your admin page, run a dev server and then navigate to `/_ah/admin`.

To view the admin page for your live server, go to
[https://console.cloud.google.com/datastore](https://console.cloud.google.com/datastore).

Use the admin page to confirm that your data is stored correctly. After you get
this step working, create a pull request and send it to your advisor for
review!

## Loading Entities

Now that you have data stored in Datastore, you can load it whenever a user
requests it.

The `todo-list` example contains a
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-2-server/examples/todo-list/src/main/java/com/google/sps/servlets/ListTasksServlet.java">
  ListTasksServlet.java
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
file that loads entities from Datastore.

First create a `Query` instance with the kind of entity you want to load, then
pass that `Query` into the `datastore.prepare()` function, which gives you a
`PreparedQuery` instance that contains all of the entities in Datastore with
that kind. To loop over those entities, call the `asIterable()` function.

```java
Query query = new Query("Task").addSort("timestamp", SortDirection.DESCENDING);
PreparedQuery results = datastore.prepare(query);
for (Entity entity : results.asIterable()) {
```

Then inside this loop, you can use the `entity.getProperty()` function to get
the properties that were set on each entity when it was stored in Datastore.

By storing entities when the user creates them and loading them when you need to
use them again, you can use Datastore as persistent storage even when your web
app is shut down or restarted.

### Your Turn

Next, add some code to your
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="software-product-sprint/portfolio/src/main/java/com/google/sps/servlets/DataServlet.java">
  DataServlet.java
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
file that loads comments from Datastore.

Test that your code works by running a local dev server, adding a few comments,
and then restarting your server. Your comments should remain when you refresh
the page, and even when you restart your server!

## Congratulations

<walkthrough-conclusion-trophy></walkthrough-conclusion-trophy>

Congratulations! Your portfolio page should now support comments that are
permanently stored in Datastore. Run a dev server to confirm that everything
works, and then create a pull request and send that to your advisor for a code
review!

Then go back to the comments walkthrough to continue:

```bash
teachme ~/software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-2-server/comments-walkthrough.md
```

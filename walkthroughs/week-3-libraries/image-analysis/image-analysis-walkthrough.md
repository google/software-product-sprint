# Image Analysis

## Getting Started

This walkthrough introduces Cloud Vision, which lets you analyze images.

You can return to this walkthrough anytime by running this command:

```bash
teachme ~/software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-3-libraries/image-analysis/image-analysis-walkthrough.md
```

## The Goal

The goal of this project is to use Cloud Vision to add image analysis to the
comments you implemented in week 2.

**Note:** This project requires Blobstore. Make sure you work through the
Blobstore project first! You should already have image uploads working before
continuing.

This walkthrough introduces a lot of concepts, but you don't have to use all of
them. Decide what makes sense for your goal.

Don't be afraid to get creative, but focus on finishing a
[minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)
that proves you have all of the pieces connected, and then come back later and
add extra features if you have time left over.

## Cloud Vision

[Cloud Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) is a set of tools designed for
image analysis.

The Cloud Vision APIs use machine learning models that have already been
trained, so you can skip straight to the fun stuff. It's also possible to train
your own models (you can learn more about that
[here](https://cloud.google.com/automl/)), but this guide is going to stick with
the pre-trained models.

## Enable Cloud Vision API

Before you can use the Cloud Vision API, you have to enable it. Go here:

<https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=vision.googleapis.com>

Make sure your project is selected, and click the `Enable` button.

## Credentials

The Cloud Vision API requires your Cloud project's credentials to work. When you
deploy to App Engine this will work automatically, but when deploying to a dev
server you have to set your credentials manually. Follow the steps
[here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) to set up
your local credentials.

**Important:** Before proceeding, make sure you have your
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable set. Nothing will work
without this.

## Maven Dependency

The Cloud Vision API is available as a web service, or as a library that can be
called from many languages. You're going to use it as a Java library. To add the
library to your classpath, add this Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-cloud-vision</artifactId>
  <version>1.70.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Add this dependency to the
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="software-product-sprint/portfolio/pom.xml">
  pom.xml
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
file in your portfolio directory.

## Example

The `image-analyzer` directory contains an example project that generates labels
for an image uploaded by a user.

The
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-3-libraries/image-analysis/examples/image-analyzer/src/main/webapp/index.jsp">
  index.jsp
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
file gets the Blobstore upload URL and uses it as the form's `action`
attribute. This allows a user to upload an image, which gets stored in
Blobstore, and then the request is forwarded to the `/image-analysis` URL. This
URL maps to the `ImageAnalysisServlet` class.

The core of the logic in
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-3-libraries/image-analysis/examples/image-analyzer/src/main/java/com/google/sps/servlets/ImageAnalysisServlet.java">
  ImageAnalysisServlet.java
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
is this code:

```java
// Get the BlobKey that points to the image uploaded by the user.
BlobKey blobKey = getBlobKey(request, "image");

// Get the labels of the image that the user uploaded.
byte[] blobBytes = getBlobBytes(blobKey);
List<EntityAnnotation> imageLabels = getImageLabels(blobBytes);

for(EntityAnnotation label : imageLabels){
  out.println("<li>" + label.getDescription() + " " + label.getScore());
}
```

This code calls a few helper functions to prepare the input data, and then it
calls the `getImageLabels()` function.

The `getImageLabels()` function contains all of the logic for sending a request
to the Cloud Vision API and processing the response to get the labels for an
uploaded image.

To run this example, first make sure your `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
environment variable is set and that you've enabled the
[Vision API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=vision.googleapis.com),
and then run a dev server.

## Your Turn

Your goal is to use the concepts you just learned about to add image analysis to
the comments you implemented in week 2.

**Note:** This project requires Blobstore. Make sure you work through the
Blobstore project first! You should already have image uploads working before
continuing.

Try to break this goal down into smaller steps, and then take each step on
individually.

-   Add the Cloud Vision dependency to your
    <walkthrough-editor-open-file
        filePath="software-product-sprint/portfolio/pom.xml">
      pom.xml
    </walkthrough-editor-open-file>
    file.
-   Modify your servlet that handles file upload requests to also fetch labels
    for the uploaded image.
    -   Test that this works by printing the labels to the console.
    -   When you get this step working, create a pull request and send it to
        your advisor for review!
-   Add the labels to the JSON returned by your servlet.
    -   Test that this works by running a dev server and viewing the JSON in your
        browser.
    -   When you get this step working, create a pull request and send it to
        your advisor for code review!
-   Add JavaScript code that reads the labels from the JSON and displays them
    under the `<img>` tag.

If you follow those steps, your portfolio should contain a working image
analysis feature!

## Live Server

When you're happy with your feature and you're ready to show it to the world,
you can deploy it to your live server!

Your
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="software-product-sprint/portfolio/pom.xml">
  pom.xml
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
file should already contain your project ID. If so, you can deploy to your live
server by executing this command:

```bash
mvn package appengine:deploy
```

After the command successfully completes, you can navigate to
`YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com` to see your portfolio and test your feature.

When you're done, share this link in the chat and with your team!

## Congratulations

<walkthrough-conclusion-trophy></walkthrough-conclusion-trophy>

Congratulations! Your portfolio page should now support image analysis.

Make sure your code is submitted to your repo before the end of the week.

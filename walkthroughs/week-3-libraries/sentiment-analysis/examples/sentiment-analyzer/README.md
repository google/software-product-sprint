To run this example, first make sure your `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
environment variable is set and that you've enabled the
[Natural Language API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/language.googleapis.com),
and then execute this command:

```
mvn package appengine:run
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
